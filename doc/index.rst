1CPN model documentation
======================================

1CPN Website: https://lequieu.github.io/1cpn-model/ 

1CPN GitHub: https://github.com/lequieu/1cpn-model

The documentation here is for the 1CPN model implementation in LAMMPS. If you haven't read the 1CPN paper yet, it might be a good idea to read this first. Unfortunately, it's currently *In Press* but should be in print very soon.

Lequieu, Cordoba, Moller, de Pablo "1CPN: A coarse-grained multi-scale model of chromatin" (2019) `J. Chem. Phys. 150, 215102 <https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5092976>`_

In everything that follows, we'll be describing the technical details of 1CPN without much regard to why we're discussing them.

If in doubt, start with the "quickstart" guide.

If you have any issues with 1CPN, please let us know on the our `GitHub issues page <https://github.com/lequieu/1cpn-model/issues>`_ page. Please don't hesitate to reach out, we're just grad students and postdocs like you probably are :)

Also, we welcome pull requests and so if you'd like to contribute to any part of the 1CPN project please let us know.
